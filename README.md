## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-  ðŸ’¬ hey, i'm Muhammad Ali Kalantari
-  i'm a c++ developer, although most of my projects here are going to be my webapps.
-  i know unrealengine pretty well and for the last 3 years i have worked on numerous personal projects. yet have much to learn.
-  maybe in the next year or two i release my currently under development mobile game.
-  i truly love css and i hope more development environments directly adopt it, like electron or make up something similar to it, like qml.
-  âš¡ the future is a.i. and nuclear power plants. ðŸŒ±
